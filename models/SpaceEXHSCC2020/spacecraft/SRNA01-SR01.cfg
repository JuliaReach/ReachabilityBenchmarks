# COMMENT: removing forbidden region (x<-100) since supp/stc have trouble checking strict inequality and anyhow x>=-100 is guaranteed by the invarant.
#          as an alternative, use x<-100-eps for any positive value of eps
# according to the report, the constraint is that v should be a circle of radius 0.055, which approximated by an inscribed octagon of bounding box diameter
# , so bounding box radius is 0.05081337428 m/s = 3.04880245729 m/min; the diagonal constraints are vx+vy <= 4.31165778409 etc.
